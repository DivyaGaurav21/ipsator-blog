loadStytch initializes the Stytch Backend SDK using your project's id and secret. The Backend SDK can be used 
on any code paths that run server side. In a Next.js app that typically means in getServerSideProps and API routes.

In this example, we use the Backend SDK in getServerSideProps for the protected page /profile which can only be viewed if the user has an active Stytch session.
